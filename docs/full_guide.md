# Random Command

This command is here to help you make decisions (if you are willing to accept the result), also can generate an __pseudo-random__ number between the numbers that you want, Look it:

```bash
$ gocharm random -1 {<number 1>} -2 {<number 2>}
```
if you don't provide any flags, number 1 will default to zero and number 2 will default to 99.

## Decisions Subcommand

This subcommand is used... well to make decisions, See it i action:

```bash
$ gocharm random decisions -1 "{<decision 1>}" -2 "{<decision 2>}"
```

The... beutiful output:

```bash


Gocharm says:

   Go for {<decision 1>}.

Gocharm speaked. Gocharm out.

```

For decision 1, for decision 2:

```bash


Gocharm says:

   Your destiny is {<decision >}.

Gocharm speaked. Gocharm out.

```

Pretty cool, huh.

Well that's it for this __command.__
